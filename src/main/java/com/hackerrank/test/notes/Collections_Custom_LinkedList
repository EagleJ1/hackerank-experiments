A link is an object
Each link has a ref to another link in the list
The linkedList has only a reference to the last Link added to it.
ANAOLOGY
LinkedList = (bilir kisi, observer) I have the address for the newest guy in town.
firstLink = I am the newest guy, and I have the address for the Guy who moved in here before me.
next = I am the guy who is known by firstLink the guy who moved here after me.

NEW LINK ADDED ?
New Link is created.
This new link's next will be referencing to the current firstlink
Than, linkedlist's firstlink will be the new link in linkedlist.

LINK REMOVED?
The linkedList's firstLink is assigned the value of the current firstlink's next

CYCLE THROUGH ALL LINKS
Start at the reference stored in firstLink for the LinkedList
Get the references stored in next for every Link until next returns null

FIND A LINK IN LINKED LISTS
Check the data for the firstlink reference stored in the linkedlist
if you do not get a match continue searching every reference stored in next until next returns null.

HOW TO REMOVE SPECIFIC LINK?
Cycle through all Links until there is a match
If the referenced Link stored in the LinkedList's firstLink matches
    - Store the reference next in firstLink as firstLink
if a match occurs elsewhere, find the Link that next equals the ref to remove
Get the reference named next in the link to remove and assign it to the link above.
