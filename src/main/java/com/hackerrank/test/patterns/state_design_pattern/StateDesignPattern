What is State Design Pattern?
- Allows an object to alter its behaviour when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
- Context (Account) : Maintains an instance of a ConcreteState subclass that defines the current state.
- State : Defines an interface for encapsulating the behaviour associated with a particular state of the Context.
- Concrete State : Each subclass implements a behaviour associated with a state of Context

Analogy ATM Machine :
* ATM Has possible states,
    - HasCardInserted
    - NoCardInserted
    - HasPin
    - NoCash
* Possible different ways the user could use an ATM.
    - Insert Card
    - Eject Card
    - Insert Pin
    - Request Cash
