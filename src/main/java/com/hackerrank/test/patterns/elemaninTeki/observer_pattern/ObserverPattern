When to use the observer pattern?
- When you need many other projects to receive an update when another object changes
    * Stock market with thousands of stocks needs to send updates to objects representing individual stocks
    * The subject (publisher) sends many updates for the stocks to the Observers
    * The observers (subscribers) takes the ones they want and use them

- Loose coupling is a benefit of this Observer Pattern.
    * The subject (publisher) does not need to know anything about the Observers (subscribers)

- DISADVANTAGES
    * The Subject (publisher) may send updates that do not matter to the Observer (subscriber)
