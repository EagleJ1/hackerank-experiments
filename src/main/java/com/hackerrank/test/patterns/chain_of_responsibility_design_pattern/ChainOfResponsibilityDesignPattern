What is Chain of Responsbility Design Pattern?
- This pattern sends data to an object and if that object cant use it, it sends it to any number of
other objects that may be able to use it.
    * Create 4 objects that can either add, substract, multiply, or divide
    * Send 2 number and a command and allow these 4 objects to decide which an handle the requested calculation.
