What is the Decorator Design Pattern?
- The Decorator allows you to modify an object dynamically.
- You would use it when you want the capabilities of inheritance with subclasses, but you need to add functionality at run time.
- It is more flexible than inheritance.
- Simplifies code because you add functionality using many simple classes.
- Rather than rewrite old code, you can extend with new code.


ForExample : Inheritance has limitations if you imagine to build Pizza
You can abstract Pizza and extend it in subclasses suchas ThreeCheesePizza,
In this subclasses you may have different tpye of toppings and amount. However, it forces you to put static values and limits the type of pizza with its amount.
Therefore, we need to use decorated design pattern and use dynamic way instread of static way. We are going to use composition again.
